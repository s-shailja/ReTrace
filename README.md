# ReTrace

This repository contains the code for the implementation of ReTrace, a tractography evaluation and validation method. 

## About

ReTrace is designed as a tool for evaluation and validation of tractography methods to provide topological insight and to guide future development in this field. 

## Publication

The method is presented in our paper submitted to the Conference on Diffusion MRI (CDMRI) 2023. The pre-print version of the paper is now available and can be accessed [here](https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2023.07.03.547451v1).
